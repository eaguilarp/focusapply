Repository for job apply technical test

This is the results of the application technical test and my personal info, I'm sorry to not complete al the tasks in the test, for personal issues and time, but want to thank for the oportunity and as I told during the first interview, I was not working as a developer since 2013 and don't have enough experience with the language.
thank you!!!
